# Libft
This project involves coding a C library that will include numerous general purpose functions for my programs.

## Libc functions
* `ft_isalpha`: checks for an alphabetic character;
* `ft_isdigit`: checks for a digit (0 through 9);
* `ft_isalnum`: checks for an alphanumeric character;
* `ft_isascii`: checks for an ASCII character;
* `ft_isprint`: checks for any printable character including space;
* `ft_strlen`: calculate the length of a string;
* `ft_memset`: fill memory with a constant byte;
* `ft_bzero`: zero a byte string;
* `ft_memcpy`: copy memory area not overlap;
* `ft_memmove`: copy memory area may overlap;
* `ft_strlcpy`: copy n characters of a string;
* `ft_strlcat`: concatenate two strings whose result is at most n characters;
* `ft_toupper`: convert lowercase to uppercase;
* `ft_tolower`: convert uppercase to lowercase;
* `ft_strchr`: locate the first occurrence of character in string;
* `ft_strrchr`: locate the last occurrence of character in string;
* `ft_strncmp`: compare the first n characters of two strings;
* `ft_memchr`: scan the initial n bytes of the memory area for a character;
* `ft_memcmp`: compare the first n bytes of two memory areas;
* `ft_strnstr`: locate the first occurrence of a substring within the first n characters of a string;
* `ft_atoi`: convert a string to an integer;
* `ft_calloc`: allocate dynamic memory and initialize it to zero;
* `ft_strdup`: duplicate a string.

## Additional functions
* `ft_substr`: allocates memory and returns a substring from the string. The substring starts at an index and has a maximum length;
* `ft_strjoin`: allocates memory and returns a new string, which is the result of concatenation of two strings;
* `ft_strtrim`: allocates memory and returns a copy of the string from which specified characters have been removed from the beginning and end;
* `ft_split`: allocates memory and returns an array of strings obtained by splitting the string using a character as a delimiter;
* `ft_itoa`: allocates memory and returns a string representing the integer received as an argument.
* `ft_strmapi`: applies afunction to each character of the string. A new string is created to store the results from the successive applications of the functton.
